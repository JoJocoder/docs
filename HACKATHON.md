# Hackathon

![Image](img/hackathon.png)

The goal of the Pixels Camp challenge is to single out and reward creativity and innovation by providing participants with an opportunity to work together within a time frame of 48 hours to create something awesome.

## Preface: what's changing this year

Before we move on... WIP

## Eligibility

Any Pixels Camp approved participant can apply, as long as they are on the premises during those 48 hours (within reason â€“ you are allowed to go out and get some air, sleep in a proper bed if you want to, etc.)

Groups __must be larger than 2 elements__, all of whom must be Pixels Camp participants. Teams are advised to recruit elements with a wide diversity of interests that complement each other in their knowledge areas. The broader the skills in a team, the higher the probabilities to surprise the public and the jury with innovative ideas.

To find your team members you can use [Slack][2] or [Twitter][3] to speak out to other participants, or you can meet them IRL on site when Pixels Camp starts.

__Participants can only join one project at a time__.

Ideas, concepts, and team organization are tasks that can be thought out before the event, but the project itself should be developed during the 48 hour period. Although monitoring this is nearly impossible, the jury and other members will be actively looking for proof that the team has worked and developed their ideas on the site.

## Schedule

The programming event will last exactly 48 hours, starting on the first day. You can see the full schedule [here](https://pixels.camp/schedule/).
